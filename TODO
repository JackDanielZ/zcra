- Process:
   + zcra [options: -i/--id] prg [args]
   + The tool launches prg with the args and provides pipes for stdin and stdout
   + Every character received on one side is sent to the other side (tool_stdin -> pipe[0] -> pipe[1] -> prg_stdin)
   - Script:
      ? DELAY: needed? If needed, add timer to select. When reached, continue consumption
      - MAIL support
      - Wait on more than one string
         ? Conditions

- Fix Ctrl-C issue (reproduce with zplay)
   - If pipe used, Ctrl-C is not caught by zcra. Maybe by the pipe.
- Add option --log/-l to log to a file
   - Always check that the file exists
- Add WAIT_TIME Xs/Yms EXIT/CONTINUE str
   Waits for str maximum X seconds, Y milliseconds and continue or exit
   example:
      - WAIT_TIME 2s EXIT password:
      - WAIT_TIME 100ms CONTINUE ***when scp doesn't know the host***
